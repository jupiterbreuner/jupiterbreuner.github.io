Hello, World

![Weyho!](dean.jpeg "Dean!")

I am a junior undergraduate student here at the beautiful University of Oregon. I currently major in psychology with a minor in CIT. I love to sing, play music, play sports, and spend time with my family and friends. I personally am very interested in the psychology behind business decisions and customer purchasing habits.

Here are my projects that I created for CIT 281!
